Stable tag: 1.0

This plugin simply allows you to easily add forward and backward links to your single posts.

== Description ==
I have noticed a lot of Themes come without the Navigation Links to move forward
and
back.  I hate when I can't navigate a blogs posts directly from one to the 
next so
I decided to create this plugin.  If the owner of the blog chooses to include 
these
links, now they can and not have to know how to code them in.  I know a lot
 of bloggers
are not necessarily php coders, so I figured I would create this plugin 
to make it as
easy as possible for them to add this functionality.

== Installation ==

1) Upload the 'bobsnav' folder to your plugins directory along with all content
2) Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in Wordpress
3) Set your desired settings in this Plugin's Option Page to choose the locations
